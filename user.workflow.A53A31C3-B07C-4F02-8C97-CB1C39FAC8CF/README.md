# DESCRIPTION

This workflow allows you to open the application SABnzbd and also open tabs you want to open in order to download .nzb files.

You will also be able to close all of the opened tabs by this workflow.

# INSTALLATION

In order to use this workflow you will need to install SABnzbd:
> http://sabnzbd.org/

And you will also need a newsgroup provider like:
> http://usenetstorm.com/

I show this one because it has a free service but there is a lot of them so choose wisely.


# USAGE OF THIS WORKFLOW

Set the list of other tabs in the script filter (to be done)

sab {query}

if (ALT button is also pressed)
> close SABnzbd and tabs from the list

else
> open SABnzbd and tabs from the list

end if
