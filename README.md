This is my workflows for Alfred V2.

If the folder doesn't contain any README.md file this mean that it doesn't belong to me.

In order to use these workflows you will need to: 
> download AlfredV2 (only mac)
>
> buy a mega licence to use workflows 
> > http://v2.alfredapp.com/
>
> copy a whole folder (user.workflow.QE6ND5-KKJD2-...) into :
> > /Users/[USERNAME]/Library/Application Support/Alfred 2/Alfred.alfredpreferences/workflows
>
> see requirement for workflows -> described in the README.md of each workflows folder.
