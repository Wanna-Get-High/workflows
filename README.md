This is my workflows for Alfred V2.

If the folder doesn't contain any README.md file this mean that it doesn't belong to me.

In order to use these workflows you will need to download AlfredV2 (only mac) and buy a mega licence to use workflows.
Requirement for workflows are described in README.md of each workflows folder.
