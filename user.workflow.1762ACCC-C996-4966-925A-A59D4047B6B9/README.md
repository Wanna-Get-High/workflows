# DESCRIPTION

This workflow allows you to open a folder in the Finder via bookmark.

You will be able to add bookmarks and also delete the ones you have added.

When typing the query suggestions of bookmarks are showed directly in Alfred.

It will save you a lot of time if you always jump from a folder to another :)
